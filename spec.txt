Introduction/Client-Server Setup

Client sends magic to broadcast
Server is constantly listening for broadcasts

The ping is always the 0xDEAD and the reply is always 0xC0DE

Client sends a 0xDEAD to Server, and Server responds
Server sends a 0xDEAD to Client every 2 seconds, with Timeout of 2 seconds, disconnect if timeout
Server maintains list of all clients, clients don't have to know about each other.
